Reading  Files:
To open a file we use the built-in –function open() function. The open() function returns a file object ,which has a read() method for reading content of file.
Example:
text1.txt
Hello!  Welcome to text1.txt
Goodluck! 
Bye.

>>>f=open(“text1.txt”.”r”)
>>>print(f.read))
Hello!  Welcome to text1.txt
Goodluck!
Bye.
read()   method returns the whole text but we specify how characters to return.
Example:
>>>f=open(“text1.txt”.”r”)
>>>print(f.read(5))
Hello
Read line technique:
This technique is used to read only one line of file.
Example:
>>>f=open(“text1.txt”.”r”)
>>>print(f.readline())
Hello!  Welcome to text1.txt
•	By looping through the lines of files we can  read  whole file.

Example:
>>>f=open(“text1.txt”.”r”)
>>>for i in f:
           Print(x)
Hello!  Welcome to text1.txt
Goodluck!
Bye.
Writing Files:
Creating a new file:
To create a new file we use open() method .
Example:
>>>f=open(“myfile.txt”,”x”)      // A new empty file is created
Or
>>>f=open(“myfile.txt”,”w”)      // Create a new file if doesn’t exist.
Writing to an existing file:
To write to an existing file  we  must add a parameter to open() function.
text2.txt
Hello!World.








Example:
>>>f=f.open(“text2.txt”,”a”)     //Will append to the end of the file.
>>>f.write(“Now the file has more content”)
>>>f.close()
>>>f=open(“text2.txt”.”r”)
>>>print(f.read())
Hello!World. Now the file has more content
>>>f=f.open(“text2.txt”,”w”)     //Will over write the content
>>>f.write(“Now the file has more content”)
>>>f.close()
>>>f=open(“text2.txt”.”r”)
>>>print(f.read())
Now the file has more content
