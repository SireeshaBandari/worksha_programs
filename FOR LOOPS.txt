for LOOP:
The for loop is a generic sequence iterator in Python: it can step through the items in any ordered sequence object. The for statement works on strings, lists, tuples, other built-in iterables, and new objects that we’ll see how to create later with classes.
SYNTAX:	
for<< variable name >>   in    << list >>:

>>>vowels=['a','e','i','o','u']
>>> for i in vowels:
...            print(i)
...
a
e
i
o
u
NESTED for LOOPS:
for example,
>>> outer=['Li','Na','K']
>>> inner=['F','Cl','Br']
>>> for metal in outer:
...            for halogen in inner:
...                       print(metal + halogen)
...
LiF         LiCl        LiBr
