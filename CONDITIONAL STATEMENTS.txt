CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:
1.if statement
2.else statement
3.elif statement
4.Nested if
if statement:
   An if statement’s clause (that is, the block following the if statement) will execute if the statement’s condition is True. The clause is skipped
if the condition is False.
syntax:
if<<condition>>:
   <<block>>
for example, 

if(n==0):
        print("number is zero")
else statement:
An if clause can optionally be followed by an else statement. The else clause is executed only when the if statement’s condition is False. 
syntax:
if<<condition>>:
   <<block>>
else:
    <<block>>
for example,
if(n==0):
      print("number is zero")
else:
       print("number is nonzero")
elif statement:
While only one of the if or else clauses will execute, you may have a case where you want one of many possible clauses to execute. The elif statement is an “else if” statement that always follows an if or another elif statement. It provides another condition that is checked only if any of the previous conditions were False. In code, an elif statement always consists of the following: 
for example,
if name == 'Diya':    
     print('Hi, Diya.') 
elif age < 12:    
     print('You are not Diya, kiddo.') 
Nested if statement:
if statement inside an another if statement
for example,
#largest number in a,b,c
if(a>b):
        if(a>c):
                print("a is largest",a)
        else:
                 print("c is largest",c)
else:
         if(b>c):
               print("b is largest",b)
         else:
               print("c is largest",c)
