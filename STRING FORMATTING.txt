String  Formatting :
The format() method used to  format  selected  parts of string. Some time there are parts of text that we can’t control or they come from a database.
To control such values , add placeholders({}) in the text and run the values through format() method.
Example:
>>>name=”Krishna”
>>>txt=”His name is {}”
>>print(txt.formate(name))
His name is Krishna
We can add parameters inside curly braces to specify how to convert value.
Example:
>>>price=49
>>>txt=”The price is {:.2f} dollars”
>>>print(txt.format(price))
The price is 49.00 dollars
Multiple Values:
We can add more values to the format() method and add more placeholders.
Example:
>>>quantity=4
>>>items=546
>>>price=50
>>>myorder=”I want {} pieces of item number {} for {:.2f} dollars.”
>>>print(myorder.format(quantity,items,price)
I want 4 pieces of item number 546 for 50.00 dollars.

Index Numbers:
Index numbers   ( {0} ) are used to refer to the same value more than once.
Example:
>>>age=36
>>>name=”Ravi”
>>>txt=”His name is {1}.{1} is {0}.
>>>print(txt.format(age,name))
His name is Ravi. Ravi is 36.
Named Indexing:
We use named indexing by entering a name inside the curly brackets {carname}, but when we pass the parameters we must use names.
Example:
>>>myorder=”I have a {carname}  ,it is a {model}.
>>>print(myorder.format(carname=”Ford”,model=”Mustang”))
I have a Ford ,it is a Mustang
