OPERATORS AND EXPRESSIONS:An operator is a symbol that tells the computer to perform certain mathematical or logical  manipulations.
Types of operators:
1. Arithmetic operators
2.  Comparision operators
3. Logical operators
4. Bitwise operators
5. Assignment operators
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:

+	Addition: adds two operands	x + y
-	Subtraction: subtracts two operands	x - y
*	Multiplication: multiplies two operands	x * y
/	Division (float): divides the first operand by the second	x / y
//	Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second	x // y
%	Modulus: returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second	x % y

COMPARISION OPERATORS:
>	Greater than: True if left operand is greater than the right	x > y
<	Less than: True if left operand is less than the right	x < y
==	Equal to: True if both operands are equal	x == y
!=	Not equal to - True if operands are not equal	x != y
>=	Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right	x <= y
LOGICAL OPERATORS:
and	Logical AND: True if both the operands are true	x and y
or	Logical OR: True if either of the operands is true	x or y
not	Logical NOT: True if operand is false	not x
BITWISE  OPERATORS:
&	Bitwise AND	x & y
|	Bitwise OR	x | y
~	Bitwise NOT	~x
^	Bitwise XOR	x ^ y
>>	Bitwise right shift	x>>
<<	Bitwise left shift	x<<
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:
=	Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand	x = y + z
+=	Add AND: Add right side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand	a+=b     a=a+b
-=	Subtract AND: Subtract right operand from left operand and then assign to left operand	a-=b       a=a-b
*=	Multiply AND: Multiply right operand with left operand and then assign to left operand	a*=b       a=a*b
/=	Divide AND: Divide left operand with right operand and then assign to left operand	a/=b         a=a/b
%=	Modulus AND: Takes modulus using left and right operands and assign result to left operand	a%=b   a=a%b
//=	Divide(floor) AND: Divide left operand with right operand and then assign the value(floor) to left operand	a//=b       a=a//b
**=	Exponent AND: Calculate exponent(raise power) value using operands and assign value to left operand	a**=b     a=a**b
&=	Performs Bitwise AND on operands and assign value to left operand	a&=b     a=a&b
|=	Performs Bitwise OR on operands and assign value to left operand	a|=b         a=a|b
^=	Performs Bitwise xOR on operands and assign value to left operand	a^=b       a=a^b
>>=	Performs Bitwise right shift on operands and assign value to left operand	a>>=b     a=a>>b
	 OPERATOR PRECEDENCE:
Operators	Meaning
()	Parentheses
**	Exponent
+x, -x, ~x	Unary plus, Unary minus, Bitwise NOT
*, /, //, %	Multiplication, Division, Floor division, Modulus
+, -	Addition, Subtraction
<<, >>	Bitwise shift operators
&	Bitwise AND
^	Bitwise XOR
|	Bitwise OR
==, !=, >, >=, <, <=, is, is not, in, not in	Comparisions, Identity, Membership operators
not	Logical NOT
and	Logical AND
or	Logical OR
	


OPERAND: The quantity on which an operation is to be done.
EXPRESSION:Combination of both operan and operation is called an expression.
