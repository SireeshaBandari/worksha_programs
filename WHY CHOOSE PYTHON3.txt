WHY PYTHON?

Python code is designed to be readable, and hence, reusable and maintainable—much more so than traditional scripting languages. The uniformity of Python code makes it easy to understand, even if you did not write it. In addition, Python has deep support for more advanced software reuse mechanisms, such as object-oriented programming (OOP).

The uniformity of Python code makes it easy to understand, even if you did not write it. In addition, Python has deep support for more advanced software reuse mechanisms, such as object-oriented programming (OOP).Most Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms. Porting Python code between Linux and Windows, for example, is usually just a matter of copying a script’s code between machines.It supports libraries.

PYTHON 3 VS   PYTHON 2:
Unicode and strings, Division with integers, Rules of ordering comparisions,Leak of variables,many recent  developers are creating libraries which you can only use with python 3.
