DATATYPES:
                                Every value in python has a particular type,  a datatype is a category for values and every values belongs to exactly one datatype.
Basic data types: Integer(int),floating point(float),string(str)
Integers are whole numbers with a range of values supported by a particular machine. Numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, are called floating-point numbers (or floats). Note that even though the value 42 is an integer, the value 42.0 would be a floating-point number. Strings are sequences of character data. String literals may be delimited using either single or double quotes. All the characters between the opening delimiter and matching closing delimiter are part of the string.
Integers                               : 2, 67, -452, 370, 9, 74
Floating point numbers   : 0.5, -1.0, 553.9, 67.5, 8.2
Strings                                 : “  a”,’’ Sunny‘’,” 24 bikes”
