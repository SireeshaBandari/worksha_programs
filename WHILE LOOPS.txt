while LOOP:
You can make a block of code execute over and over again with a while statement. The code in a while clause will be executed as long as the while statement’s condition is True. 
In code, a while statement always consists of the following:
 •The while keyword
 •A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False) 
•A colon 
•Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the while clause)
syntax:
while<<condition>>:
         <<block>>
for example:
>>> i=0
>>> while i<5:
                   print(i)
        i=i+1
0
