VARIABLES: A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc. Variables can be declared by any name or even alphabets like a, aa, abc, etc.
STORING VALUES IN VARIABLES:     A variable is like a box in the computer’s memory where you can store a single value. If you want to use the result of an evaluated expression later in your program, you can save it inside a variable.
ASSINGNMENT STATEMENTS: You’ll store values in variables with an assignment statement. An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal sign (called the assignment operator), and the value to be stored. If you enter the assignment statement birds=34, then a variable named birds will have the integer value 34 stored in it.
>>>birds = 34
>>>birds
34
A variable is initialized (or created) the first time a value is stored in it . After that, you can use it in expressions with other variables and values . When a variable is assigned a new value , the old value is forgotten. This is called overwriting the variable. 
>>>name=’sunny’
>>>name
‘sunny’
>>>name=’Diya’
>>>name
‘Diya’
RULES FOR  NAMING VARIABLES :
1. It can be only one word. 
2. It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character. 
3. It can’t begin with a number.
4.cannot use a keyword(ex- def, true, false, break, class, import, while)
