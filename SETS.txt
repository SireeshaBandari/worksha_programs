Sets:
A set is an unordered and unindexed collection. Sets are written with curly braces ({}).
Example:
>>>s = {“white”,”yellow”,”purple”}
>>>print(s)
{‘white’,’yellow’,’purple’}
Accessing of Items in a Set:
Set is an unordered collection so we can’t access items using index. But we can access items in sets using for loop.
Example:
>>>s = {“white”,”yellow”,”purple”}
>>>for x in s :
             print(x)
white
yellow
purple
•	To find  an  item is present in the given set or not
Example:
>>> s = {“white”,”yellow”,”purple”}
>>>print(“white” in s)
True
Sets Methods:
Python has a set of built-in-functions used on sets.
add() method is used to add an item to a set.
Example:
>>> s = {“white”,”yellow”,”purple”}
>>>s.add(“pink”)

>>>print(s)
{‘white’,’yellow’,’purple’,’pink’}
>>> s = {“white”,”yellow”,”purple”}
>>>print(len(s))
3
remove() or discard() method is used to remove an item from set.
Example:
>>> s = {“white”,”yellow”,”purple”}
>>>s.remove(“yellow”)
>>>print(s)
{‘white’,’purple’}
clear() method is used to empty a  set.
Example:
>>> s = {“white”,”yellow”,”purple”}
>>>s.clear()
>>>print(s)
set()
•	delete() method is used to delete set completely.
union() or update() method is used to join to sets.
Example:
>>> s = {“white”,”yellow”,”purple”}
>>>p={“”a”,”b”,”c”}
>>>s.update(p)

>>>print(s)
{‘a’,’yellow’,’b’,’c’,’purple’,’white’}
